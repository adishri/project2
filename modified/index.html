            <p>Jaaga Study is a residential colearning space located just outside Bangalore.
            We believe people can learn new technologies that will make them effective in
            the digital economy while living inexpensively on an organic farm. In addition
            to learning software development we work on the farm, do yoga, meditate, fly
            quadcopters, ride electric unicycles, and generally explore new technologies
            in a natural environment.

            The core of Jaaga Study is a one year program in which people learn to write
            software and gain experience working in teams on practical social service projects.
            The year at Jaaga Study is divided into 3 month quarters. The first quarter of the
            one year program is a ‘bootcamp’ where people focus their efforts on learning a
            particular technology stack. This is the most directed part of the program. In
            successive quarters people work in teams on CodeForIndia Fellowships. In the
            last quarter participants work on projects of their own choosing. This can
            either be another CFI Fellowship or an entrepreneurial venture they wish to undertake.

            During Bootcamp people dedicate their time to completing online computer science
            classes which help them get familiar with a particular technology. They participate
            in online code challenges, and create a project that demonstrates their familiarity
            with the technology and submit it as open source on GitHub. Participants learn how to
            provision a server in the cloud and deploy their web project to it. People stay in
            Bootcamp mode until they are eligible for a CodeForIndia fellowship. This is a minimum
            of 3 and maximum of 6 months.</p>
